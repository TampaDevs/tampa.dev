# Error Catalog

All API errors return a JSON object with two fields:

```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable description of the problem",
  "code": "machine_readable_error_code"
}
```

The `code` field is stable and safe to use in programmatic error handling. The `error` message may change and is intended for developer debugging.

---

## `unauthorized` (401)

The request has no valid authentication credentials.

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "code": "unauthorized"
}
```

**Common causes:**
- Missing `Authorization` header
- Expired or revoked token
- Malformed Bearer token
- Invalid session cookie

---

## `forbidden` (403)

The authenticated user is not authorized to perform this action.

```json
{
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "code": "forbidden"
}
```

**Common causes:**
- Non-admin user accessing admin endpoints
- User without the required group role (e.g., trying to manage a group they don't own)
- Attempting to modify another user's resources

---

## `insufficient_scope` (403)

The token is valid but lacks the required OAuth scope. The response includes a `WWW-Authenticate` header identifying the missing scope.

```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_scope", scope="write:events"
```

```json
{
  "error": "This endpoint requires the 'write:events' scope",
  "code": "insufficient_scope"
}
```

**Fix:** Create a new token with the required scope, or request the scope during OAuth authorization.

---

## `not_found` (404)

The requested resource does not exist.

```json
{
  "error": "Event not found",
  "code": "not_found"
}
```

**Common causes:**
- Invalid resource ID or slug
- Resource was deleted
- User profile is private

---

## `conflict` (409)

The request conflicts with the current state of the resource.

```json
{
  "error": "Username is already taken",
  "code": "conflict"
}
```

**Common causes:**
- Duplicate username
- Already RSVPed to an event
- Already following a user
- Badge already awarded to user

---

## `gone` (410)

The resource existed but is no longer available.

```json
{
  "error": "This claim link has expired",
  "code": "gone"
}
```

**Common causes:**
- Claim link has expired
- Claim link has reached its maximum uses
- Event has been cancelled

---

## `validation_error` (400)

The request body failed schema validation.

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid input",
  "code": "validation_error"
}
```

Zod validation errors may include additional details about which fields failed. Always validate request bodies match the expected schema before sending.

---

## `bad_request` (400)

The request is malformed or missing required data.

```json
{
  "error": "Request body is required",
  "code": "bad_request"
}
```

**Common causes:**
- Missing required fields
- Invalid query parameters
- Malformed JSON body
- Missing `Content-Type: application/json` header

---

## `rate_limited` (429)

Too many requests in the current time window. The response includes a `Retry-After` header.

```
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 60
```

```json
{
  "error": "Too many requests",
  "code": "rate_limited"
}
```

**Fix:** Wait the number of seconds indicated by the `Retry-After` header before retrying. See [Rate Limits](/developer/docs/rate-limits) for per-endpoint limits.

---

## `internal_error` (500)

An unexpected server error occurred. The error message is always generic to avoid leaking internal details.

```json
{
  "error": "Internal server error",
  "code": "internal_error"
}
```
