# Personal Access Tokens

Personal Access Tokens (PATs) provide a simpler alternative to the full OAuth flow.
Create tokens in your [Profile settings](/profile).

## Usage

Include the token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer td_pat_abc123..." \
  https://api.tampa.dev/v1/profile
```

## Token Format

Tokens are prefixed with `td_pat_` followed by 40 hex characters. The full token is only shown once at creation time. We store a SHA-256 hash for verification.

Example: `td_pat_a1b2c3d4e5f6...`

## Scopes

PATs use the same scope system as OAuth tokens. When creating a token, select the scopes your integration needs. Token scopes cannot exceed your user permissions.

## Security Best Practices

- **Never commit tokens** to version control or share them publicly
- **Use the minimum scopes** required for your integration
- **Set expiration dates** for tokens used in CI/CD or automated workflows
- **Revoke tokens** immediately if they are compromised
- **Rotate tokens** regularly for long-lived integrations
