# Personal Access Tokens

Personal Access Tokens (PATs) provide a simpler alternative to the full OAuth flow.
Create tokens in your [Profile settings](/profile) or programmatically via the API.

## Usage

Include the token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer td_pat_abc123..." \
  https://api.tampa.dev/v1/profile
```

## Token Format

Tokens are prefixed with `td_pat_` followed by 40 hex characters. The full token is only shown once at creation time. We store a SHA-256 hash for verification.

Example: `td_pat_a1b2c3d4e5f6...`

## Scopes

PATs use the same scope system as OAuth tokens. When creating a token, select the scopes your integration needs. Token scopes cannot exceed your user permissions.

See [Scopes](/developer/docs/scopes) for the full list of available scopes.

## Management Scopes

PATs can include management scopes for programmatic access to group and event management:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `manage:groups` | Manage groups you own or co-manage (settings, members, claims) |
| `manage:events` | Create and manage events in your groups |
| `manage:checkins` | Manage checkin codes and view attendees |
| `manage:badges` | Create, award, and manage group badges |

Management scopes require that your user account has the corresponding group role (owner, manager, or volunteer). The PAT scope grants API access, but group role checks still apply.

## Token Management API

You can manage PATs programmatically. All endpoints require the `user` scope.

### List tokens

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer td_pat_abc123..." \
  https://api.tampa.dev/v1/profile/tokens
```

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "tok_abc123",
      "name": "CI/CD Pipeline",
      "tokenPrefix": "td_pat_a1b2",
      "scopes": "read:events,read:groups",
      "expiresAt": "2026-06-15T00:00:00Z",
      "createdAt": "2025-12-15T10:00:00Z",
      "lastUsedAt": "2026-01-30T14:22:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Create a token

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer td_pat_abc123..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Bot",
    "scopes": ["read:events", "read:groups", "write:favorites"],
    "expiresInDays": 90
  }' \
  https://api.tampa.dev/v1/profile/tokens
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "tok_def456",
    "name": "My Bot",
    "token": "td_pat_a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2",
    "tokenPrefix": "td_pat_a1b2",
    "scopes": "read:events,read:groups,write:favorites",
    "expiresAt": "2026-05-01T10:00:00Z",
    "createdAt": "2026-01-31T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

The `token` field contains the full token value. **Store it securely -- it cannot be retrieved again.**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Human-readable name (1-100 chars) |
| `scopes` | string[] | Yes | OAuth scopes to grant |
| `expiresInDays` | integer | No | 1-365 days until expiry |

### Revoke a token

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer td_pat_abc123..." \
  https://api.tampa.dev/v1/profile/tokens/tok_def456
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "success": true
  }
}
```

## Security Best Practices

- **Never commit tokens** to version control or share them publicly
- **Use the minimum scopes** required for your integration
- **Set expiration dates** for tokens used in CI/CD or automated workflows
- **Revoke tokens** immediately if they are compromised
- **Rotate tokens** regularly for long-lived integrations
