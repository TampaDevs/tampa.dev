# MCP Prompts

The Tampa Devs MCP server includes reusable prompt templates that help AI agents interact with the platform effectively. Prompts provide structured conversation starters for common workflows such as generating community reports, suggesting events, and guiding users through onboarding.

Prompts are not executable actions -- they return pre-built message templates that an AI agent can use to structure its interaction with the user and the platform's tools and resources.

## Available Prompts

| Prompt | Arguments | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `community_health_report` | `group_slug` (required) | Generate a community health report for a group |
| `suggest_events` | None | Suggest events based on the user's interests and history |
| `onboarding_guide` | None | Guide a new user through platform features and setup |
| `group_setup_guide` | `group_id` (required) | Guide a group organizer through initial group configuration |
| `badge_strategy` | `group_slug` (required) | Suggest badge and achievement strategies for a group |

## How Prompts Help Agents

Prompts serve as structured blueprints for multi-step agent workflows. Instead of an AI agent needing to figure out which tools to call and in what order, a prompt provides a clear plan:

1. **Reduced trial and error** -- the prompt tells the agent exactly which tools to invoke and what data to gather.
2. **Consistent output** -- prompts define the expected output structure (sections, recommendations, comparisons), leading to reliable results.
3. **Domain knowledge** -- prompts embed Tampa Devs-specific best practices that a general-purpose AI agent would not know on its own.
4. **User guidance** -- prompts include instructions for the agent to ask for user confirmation before making changes, keeping the user in control.

Agents can use prompts as-is or adapt them based on additional context from the conversation.
