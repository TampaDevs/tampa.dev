# Rate Limits

API requests are rate-limited to prevent abuse. Current limits:

- **Authenticated requests**: 1,000 requests per hour
- **Unauthenticated requests**: 60 requests per hour
- **Webhook deliveries**: Best-effort, no rate limit on outbound

## Rate Limit Headers

Rate limit headers are included in every API response:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Requests allowed per hour |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Remaining requests in current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the window resets |

## Handling Rate Limits

When you exceed the rate limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Check the `X-RateLimit-Reset` header to determine when you can retry.

```bash
# Example response headers when rate limited
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1706547200
Retry-After: 3600
```

Best practices:
- Cache responses when possible to reduce API calls
- Implement exponential backoff on 429 responses
- Use webhooks instead of polling for real-time updates
