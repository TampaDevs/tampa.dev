## Subscribing to Admin Events

Admin-restricted events can only be subscribed to by users with admin or superadmin roles. Use the Developer Portal to create webhooks that include these event types.

When creating webhooks via the API, include the admin event types in the `eventTypes` array:

```
POST /developer/webhooks
```

The API will verify your role before allowing the subscription.
