# Scopes

Scopes follow the GitHub model. The `user` scope implicitly includes `read:user` and `user:email`.

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `user` | Read/write access to profile info (includes user:email and read:user) |
| `read:user` | Read your public profile data |
| `user:email` | Read your email address |
| `read:events` | Read events and event details |
| `read:groups` | Read groups and group details |
| `read:favorites` | Read your favorite groups |
| `write:favorites` | Manage your favorite groups |
| `read:portfolio` | Read your portfolio items |
| `write:portfolio` | Manage your portfolio items |
| `user:linked-accounts` | Read your connected identity providers |
| `admin` | Full admin access |

## Scope Hierarchy

The `user` scope is a parent scope that automatically grants:
- `read:user` - read-only access to profile data
- `user:email` - read access to email addresses

When requesting scopes during authorization, only request what your application needs. Users will see the full list of requested permissions on the consent screen.

## Requesting Scopes

Include scopes as a space-separated string in the `scope` parameter of the authorization URL:

```
https://tampa.dev/oauth/authorize?scope=read:user read:events read:groups
```
