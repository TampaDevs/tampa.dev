# Scopes

Scopes follow the GitHub model. The `user` scope implicitly includes `read:user` and `user:email`.

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `user` | Read/write access to profile info (includes user:email and read:user) |
| `read:user` | Read your public profile data |
| `user:email` | Read your email address |
| `read:events` | Read events and event details |
| `read:groups` | Read groups and group details |
| `read:favorites` | Read your favorite groups |
| `write:favorites` | Manage your favorite groups |
| `read:portfolio` | Read your portfolio items |
| `write:portfolio` | Manage your portfolio items |
| `user:linked-accounts` | Read your connected identity providers |
| `manage:groups` | Manage groups you own or co-manage |
| `manage:events` | Create and manage events in your groups |
| `manage:checkins` | Manage checkin codes and view attendees |
| `manage:badges` | Create, award, and manage group badges |
| `admin` | Full admin access |

## Scope Hierarchy

The `user` scope is a parent scope that automatically grants:
- `read:user` - read-only access to profile data
- `user:email` - read access to email addresses

When requesting scopes during authorization, only request what your application needs. Users will see the full list of requested permissions on the consent screen.

## Requesting Scopes

Include scopes as a space-separated string in the `scope` parameter of the authorization URL:

```
https://tampa.dev/oauth/authorize?scope=read:user read:events read:groups
```

## Management Scopes

Group management, event management, checkin, and badge management endpoints accept all three authentication methods: **session cookies**, **Personal Access Tokens**, and **OAuth Bearer tokens**. When using PATs or OAuth, include the appropriate `manage:*` scope.

For example, to manage groups via a PAT:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer td_pat_abc123..." \
  https://api.tampa.dev/groups/manage
```

Or request the scope during OAuth authorization:

```
https://tampa.dev/oauth/authorize?scope=manage:groups manage:events
```

## Recommended Scopes for MCP

When connecting an AI assistant via [MCP](/developer/docs/mcp-overview), the scopes you request determine which tools the agent can discover and use. Here are common configurations:

| Use Case | Recommended Scopes |
|----------|-------------------|
| Read-only browsing | `read:events read:groups read:user` |
| Personal assistant (full) | `user read:events write:events read:groups read:favorites write:favorites read:portfolio write:portfolio` |
| Group management bot | `manage:groups manage:events manage:checkins manage:badges` |
| Platform admin | `admin` |

The MCP server's `tools/list` response is automatically filtered to only include tools your token's scopes allow. This means an agent can introspect its own capabilities by listing available tools.
