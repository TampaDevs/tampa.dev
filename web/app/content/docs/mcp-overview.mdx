# MCP Overview

The Tampa Devs Platform provides a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server, enabling AI assistants, personal automation tools, and agent frameworks to interact with the Tampa Devs community programmatically.

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools and data sources. It defines a JSON-RPC 2.0 interface that allows AI models to discover and invoke tools, read structured resources, and use prompt templates -- all through a single, well-defined protocol.

MCP eliminates the need for AI agents to understand REST API conventions, pagination, or authentication flows in detail. Instead, agents discover available capabilities at runtime and invoke them through a uniform interface.

## Why Tampa.dev supports MCP

The Tampa Devs MCP server allows AI agents to:

- **Browse events and groups** -- search upcoming events, view group details, check leaderboards
- **Manage RSVPs and check-ins** -- RSVP to events, check in with codes, view attendee lists
- **Interact with profiles** -- read and update profile information, view achievements and badges
- **Manage favorites and follows** -- add/remove favorite groups, follow/unfollow users
- **Administer groups** -- create events, manage members, award badges, generate check-in codes
- **Run platform admin tasks** -- manage users, sync data, configure achievements (admin only)

All of this is governed by the same [scope system](/developer/docs/scopes) and [authentication](/developer/docs/authentication) used by the REST API, so agents operate with the same permissions as the user who authorized them.

## Server Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Server URL** | `https://api.tampa.dev/mcp` |
| **Transport** | Streamable HTTP (`POST /mcp` with JSON-RPC 2.0) |
| **Protocol version** | `2025-03-26` |
| **Discovery** | `https://api.tampa.dev/.well-known/mcp-configuration` |

## Quick Start

### 1. Discover the server

Fetch the well-known MCP configuration to confirm the server endpoint and capabilities:

```bash
curl https://api.tampa.dev/.well-known/mcp-configuration
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tampa-devs": {
      "url": "https://api.tampa.dev/mcp",
      "transport": "streamable-http",
      "authentication": {
        "type": "oauth2",
        "authorizationUrl": "https://tampa.dev/oauth/authorize",
        "tokenUrl": "https://tampa.dev/oauth/token",
        "scopes": ["read:events", "read:groups", "read:user"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Authenticate

MCP uses the same authentication as the REST API:

- **OAuth 2.1 with PKCE** -- the recommended flow for interactive AI clients. See [Authentication](/developer/docs/authentication).
- **Personal Access Token** -- simpler option for scripts and local tools. See [Personal Access Tokens](/developer/docs/personal-access-tokens).

Include the token in the `Authorization` header of every `POST /mcp` request:

```
Authorization: Bearer td_pat_abc123...
```

### 3. Initialize the session

Send an `initialize` request to establish the MCP session:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-03-26",
    "capabilities": {},
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "my-ai-agent",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

The server responds with its capabilities:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-03-26",
    "capabilities": {
      "tools": {},
      "resources": {},
      "prompts": {}
    },
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "tampa-devs-mcp",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Discover tools

List the tools available to your token's scopes:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools/list"
}
```

The response includes only the tools your token's scopes allow. See [Scope-filtered discovery](#scope-filtered-discovery) below.

### 5. Call a tool

Invoke a tool by name with the required arguments:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "events_list",
    "arguments": {
      "status": "upcoming",
      "limit": 5
    }
  }
}
```

## Capabilities

The Tampa Devs MCP server exposes three capability types:

| Capability | Description | Documentation |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Tools** | Executable actions (read data, create resources, manage settings) | [MCP Tools](/developer/docs/mcp-tools) |
| **Resources** | Read-only data accessible via `tampadev://` URIs | [MCP Resources](/developer/docs/mcp-resources) |
| **Prompts** | Reusable prompt templates for common workflows | [MCP Prompts](/developer/docs/mcp-prompts) |

## Scope-Filtered Discovery

When an AI agent calls `tools/list`, the MCP server inspects the caller's token scopes and returns only the tools the caller is authorized to use. This means:

- A token with `read:events` will see event browsing tools but not event management tools.
- A token with `manage:groups` and `manage:events` will additionally see group and event management tools.
- A token with `admin` will see the full platform administration tool set.
- Session-authenticated users (first-party web UI) see all tools, since session auth bypasses scope restrictions.

This design prevents AI agents from attempting operations they cannot perform, reducing unnecessary error handling and improving agent reliability.

## Authentication and Scopes

MCP uses the same scope system as the REST API. Request only the scopes your agent needs:

| Agent Use Case | Recommended Scopes |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Event browser | `read:events`, `read:groups` |
| Personal assistant | `read:events`, `read:user`, `read:favorites`, `write:favorites` |
| RSVP manager | `read:events`, `write:events` |
| Group organizer | `manage:groups`, `manage:events`, `manage:checkins`, `manage:badges` |
| Full admin bot | `admin` |
