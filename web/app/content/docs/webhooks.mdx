# Webhooks

Webhooks let you receive real-time HTTP POST notifications when events occur on the platform.
Register webhooks in the [Developer Portal](/developer).

## Event Types

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `event.created` | A new community event was created |
| `event.updated` | An event was updated |
| `event.deleted` | An event was removed |
| `sync.completed` | A platform sync completed |
| `user.favorite_added` | A user favorited a group |
| `user.identity_linked` | A user linked an identity provider |
| `user.badge_awarded` | A badge was awarded to a user |
| `test.ping` | Test webhook delivery |

## Payload Format

Every webhook delivery sends a JSON payload:

```json
{
  "id": "delivery-uuid",
  "type": "event.created",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-29T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "eventId": "...",
    "title": "Tampa Devs Monthly Meetup",
    "startTime": "2026-02-15T18:30:00-05:00"
  }
}
```

## Headers

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-Webhook-Signature` | HMAC-SHA256 signature: `sha256=hex_digest` |
| `X-Event-Type` | The event type (e.g. `event.created`) |
| `X-Delivery-ID` | Unique delivery identifier |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `User-Agent` | `TampaDevs-Webhooks/1.0` |

## Signature Verification

Verify the `X-Webhook-Signature` header by computing HMAC-SHA256 of the raw request body using your webhook secret:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifySignature(body, secret, signature) {
  const expected = 'sha256=' + crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(body)
    .digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expected)
  );
}
```

Always verify signatures before processing webhook payloads to ensure they originated from Tampa.dev.

## Retry Policy

If your endpoint returns a non-2xx status code or fails to respond, delivery is retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff. You can view delivery history in the Developer Portal.
