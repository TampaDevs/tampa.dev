# Badges & XP

Badges are a way to recognize participation and achievements across the Tampa.dev community. Each badge awards XP (experience points) that contribute to your rank on leaderboards.

## How Badges Work

There are two types of badges on Tampa.dev:

| Type | Description | Who creates them |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Platform badges** | Awarded for platform-wide activities and milestones | Platform admins |
| **Group badges** | Specific to a group, awarded for attending events or contributing to that community | Group managers |

Both types of badges appear on your profile and contribute to your total XP score.

## XP Scores

Every badge has a point value. When you earn a badge, its points are added to your total XP score. Your XP score determines your position on leaderboards.

Some badges are worth more points than others — rarer and harder-to-earn badges tend to award more XP.

## Leaderboards

Tampa.dev has two types of leaderboards:

- **Platform leaderboard** — Ranks all community members by total XP across all badges. View it at [/leaderboard](/leaderboard).
- **Group leaderboards** — Each group has its own leaderboard ranking members by XP earned from that group's badges only. Find them on individual group pages.

## Rarity Tiers

Every badge has a rarity tier based on what percentage of the community holds it. Rarity is dynamic — as more (or fewer) people earn a badge, its tier can change.

| Tier | Holders | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Legendary** | Less than 1% | Extremely rare, held by very few community members |
| **Epic** | 1% - 5% | Very rare, a significant achievement |
| **Rare** | 5% - 15% | Uncommon, shows dedicated participation |
| **Uncommon** | 15% - 50% | Held by an active minority of members |
| **Common** | More than 50% | Widely held across the community |

Rarity tiers are displayed on badge cards so you can see how exclusive each badge is.

## How to Earn Badges

There are several ways to earn badges on Tampa.dev:

### Claim Links

Group managers can create shareable claim links for their badges. When you visit a claim link, the badge is automatically added to your profile. Claim links may have:

- **Use limits** — Only a certain number of people can claim the badge through that link.
- **Expiration dates** — The link stops working after a set date.

Claim links are often shared at events, in chat channels, or on social media.

### Event Check-ins

Some events have check-in codes. When you check in at an event using the code, you may automatically receive a badge for attending.

### Achievements

Certain badges are awarded automatically when you reach milestones on the platform, such as:

- Attending your first event
- Joining a certain number of groups
- Maintaining a streak of event attendance
- Other community participation milestones

Achievement badges are awarded by the platform and cannot be manually claimed.
