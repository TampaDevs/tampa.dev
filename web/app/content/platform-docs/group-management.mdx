# Managing Your Group

If you're a group owner or manager on Tampa.dev, you have access to the group management dashboard. This guide covers everything you need to know about configuring and running your group.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Navigate to your group's page and click the **Manage** button (visible only to owners and managers). This takes you to the management dashboard where you can configure settings, manage members, create events, and issue badges.

## Group Settings

From the **Settings** tab, you can configure:

### Basic Information

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Your group's display name |
| **Description** | A summary of what your group is about. Supports plain text. |
| **Website** | A link to your group's external website or homepage |
| **Tags** | Topic tags that help users discover your group (e.g., "JavaScript", "AI/ML", "Networking") |

### Visuals

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Photo** | Your group's profile image or logo. Displayed on the group card and page header. |
| **Hero image** | A wide banner image displayed at the top of your group page. |
| **Theme color** | A custom accent color used throughout your group's page and cards. |

### Social Links

Add links to your group's presence on other platforms:

- Website URL
- GitHub organization
- Twitter/X account
- LinkedIn page
- Discord server
- Slack workspace
- YouTube channel

Social links appear on your group's public page as clickable icons.

## Managing Members

The **Members** tab lets you view and manage your group's membership.

### Roles

Tampa.dev groups have four roles, listed from highest to lowest privilege:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control over the group. Can manage settings, members, events, and badges. Can promote/demote any member. Can transfer ownership. |
| **Manager** | Can manage events, badges, and members (except the owner). Can promote members up to the manager role. |
| **Volunteer** | Can assist with event check-ins and basic event operations. Cannot change group settings or manage badges. |
| **Member** | A regular group member. Can view group content, attend events, and earn group badges. |

### Role Hierarchy

You can only manage members whose role is lower than yours:

- **Owners** can promote/demote anyone (managers, volunteers, members).
- **Managers** can promote members to volunteer or manager, and demote volunteers to member. They cannot affect the owner or other managers.
- **Volunteers** and **Members** cannot manage other members.

### Inviting Members

To add someone to your group, they need to have a Tampa.dev account. You can invite members from the Members tab by searching for their username.

## Leaving a Group

Any member (including managers) can leave a group at any time from the group's page. Owners must transfer ownership to another member before they can leave.
