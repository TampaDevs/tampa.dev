# Platform Administration

This guide is for Tampa.dev platform administrators. It covers the tools and workflows available in the admin dashboard for managing the platform.

## Managing Entitlements

Entitlements control what users and groups are allowed to do on the platform. The most common entitlement is **group creation** — users must have a group creation entitlement before they can create a new group.

### Granting Group Creation Entitlements

From the **Entitlements** section in the admin dashboard:

1. Search for the user by username or email.
2. Grant the `group_create` entitlement.
3. The user can now access the group creation flow.

Entitlements can be revoked at any time if needed.

## Reviewing Group Creation Requests

When a user with a group creation entitlement submits a request to create a group, it appears in the **Group Requests** queue. As an admin, you can:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Approve** | The group is created and the requesting user becomes the owner. |
| **Reject** | The request is denied. You can include a reason for the rejection. |

Review requests promptly to keep the community growing.

## Managing Claim Requests

Users may submit requests to claim ownership of existing groups (e.g., synced groups that don't yet have an owner). These appear in the **Claims** section. You can:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Approve** | The user is granted ownership of the group. |
| **Reject** | The claim is denied. |

Verify that the requester is a legitimate organizer of the group before approving.

## Feature Flags

Feature flags control which optional capabilities are available to specific groups. Manage them from the **Flags** section.

Common feature flags include:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `badge_issuer` | Allows the group to create and manage badges |
| `event_checkins` | Enables event check-in functionality for the group |
| `custom_theme` | Allows the group to set custom theme colors |

To enable a flag for a group, find the group in the flags interface and toggle the desired flag on. Flags take effect immediately.

## Badge Governance

Platform admins set the global rules for how badges work across the platform:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Max badges per group** | How many badge types each group can create |
| **Max badge points** | The maximum XP value any single badge can award |

These limits ensure the badge and XP ecosystem stays balanced. Adjust them thoughtfully — increasing limits too much can inflate leaderboard scores.

You can also create **platform-wide badges** from the admin Badges section. Platform badges are not tied to any specific group and are typically used for community-wide milestones and achievements.

## Platform Connections (Synced Groups)

Tampa.dev automatically syncs events and groups from external platforms. The **Sync** section in the admin dashboard lets you manage these connections.

### Supported Platforms

| Platform | What syncs |
|----------|------------|
| **Meetup** | Groups and their events |
| **Eventbrite** | Organizations and their events |
| **Luma** | Calendars and their events |

### The Sync System

The sync system runs on a schedule and:

1. **Discovers** new events from connected platforms.
2. **Creates or updates** event records in Tampa.dev to match the source.
3. **Handles cancellations** — if an event is cancelled on the source platform, it's marked as cancelled on Tampa.dev too.

Synced groups appear in the groups directory with a badge indicating their source platform. They function like any other group — users can favorite them, view their events, and earn badges from them.

### Managing Synced Groups

From the admin dashboard, you can:

- **Add new connections** — Connect a new Meetup group, Eventbrite organization, or Luma calendar.
- **Remove connections** — Stop syncing from a specific source.
- **Force sync** — Trigger an immediate sync instead of waiting for the next scheduled run.
- **View sync status** — See when the last sync ran and whether it completed successfully.
