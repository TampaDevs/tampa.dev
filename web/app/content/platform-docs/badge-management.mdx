# Managing Badges

Badges let you recognize and reward participation in your group. As a group owner or manager, you can create custom badges, award them to members, and share claim links.

**Prerequisite:** Badge management requires the `badge_issuer` feature flag to be enabled on your group. If you don't see the Badges tab in your management dashboard, contact a platform admin to request this feature.

## Creating Group Badges

From the **Badges** tab in your group management dashboard, click **Create Badge**. Configure the following:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Yes | The badge name (e.g., "Hackathon Champion", "January Meetup") |
| **Description** | Yes | What the badge represents and how it's earned |
| **Icon** | Yes | An emoji or icon for the badge |
| **Color** | Yes | The badge's accent color, displayed on the badge card |
| **Points** | Yes | XP points awarded when a user earns this badge |

### Badge Governance Limits

To keep the badge ecosystem balanced, groups have governance limits:

| Limit | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Max badges per group** | The maximum number of badge types a group can create. This limit is set by platform admins. |
| **Max badge points** | The maximum XP value a single badge can award. This prevents any one badge from disproportionately affecting leaderboard rankings. |

If you need higher limits for your group, reach out to a platform admin.

## Awarding Badges

You can award a badge directly to a user from the badge management interface. Search for the user by username and select the badge to award. The badge and its XP are added to the user's profile immediately.

## Revoking Badges

If a badge was awarded in error, you can revoke it from a user. Revoking a badge removes it from the user's profile and deducts the associated XP from their score.

## Creating Claim Links

Claim links are shareable URLs that let users claim a badge on their own. This is useful for:

- Distributing badges at events (share the link on a screen or in chat)
- Rewarding participation in online activities
- Running promotions or challenges

### Claim Link Options

When creating a claim link, you can configure:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Use limit** | The maximum number of times the link can be used. Once the limit is reached, the link stops working. Leave blank for unlimited uses. |
| **Expiration date** | When the link expires. After this date, the link can no longer be used to claim the badge. Leave blank for no expiration. |

### How Claim Links Work

1. You create a claim link for a specific badge.
2. Share the link URL with your audience (at an event, in a message, on social media, etc.).
3. Users visit the link and, if they're logged in, the badge is automatically added to their profile.
4. If the link has a use limit, the remaining uses decrease with each claim.

Each user can only claim a badge once through a given claim link — duplicate claims are prevented automatically.
