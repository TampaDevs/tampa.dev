# Your Profile

Your profile is your identity on Tampa.dev. It shows your bio, badges, groups, and portfolio items to other community members. You can customize it from the [Profile settings](/profile) page.

## Profile Setup

After signing up, visit your [Profile page](/profile) to fill in the basics:

- **Display name** — The name shown on your profile and in member lists.
- **Bio** — A short description about yourself. Keep it brief — a sentence or two about what you do and what you're interested in.
- **Location** — Your general location in the Tampa Bay area.

## Changing Your Username

Your username determines your public profile URL (`tampa.dev/p/your-username`). You can change it from the Profile settings page. Usernames must be unique, lowercase, and can contain letters, numbers, and hyphens.

Keep in mind that changing your username will change your profile URL. Old links to your previous username will no longer work.

## Adding Social Links

Connect your social accounts so other community members can find you elsewhere. Supported platforms include:

| Platform | What to enter |
|----------|---------------|
| GitHub | Your GitHub username |
| LinkedIn | Your LinkedIn profile URL |
| Twitter/X | Your Twitter handle |
| Website | Your personal website URL |
| Bluesky | Your Bluesky handle |
| Mastodon | Your Mastodon handle |

Social links appear as icons on your public profile page.

## Hero Image & Theme Color

Personalize the look of your profile with:

- **Hero image** — A banner image displayed at the top of your profile page. Upload any image you like — it will be displayed as a wide banner.
- **Theme color** — A custom accent color used on your profile page. Pick a color that represents you.

These customizations make your profile stand out when other members visit it.

## Portfolio Items

Showcase your projects, talks, articles, or other work by adding portfolio items to your profile. Each item includes:

- **Title** — The name of the project or work
- **Description** — A brief summary of what it is
- **URL** — A link to the project, article, or resource

Portfolio items appear on your public profile, making it easy for other community members (and potential collaborators or employers) to see what you've built.

## Privacy & Visibility

Your profile is public by default — other community members can view your profile page, badges, and groups. Here's what's visible:

| Information | Visibility |
|-------------|------------|
| Display name & bio | Public |
| Badges & XP | Public |
| Groups you belong to | Public |
| Portfolio items | Public |
| Social links | Public |
| Email address | Private (never shown publicly) |
| Favorited groups | Private |

If you prefer to keep a lower profile, you can minimize what you share by leaving optional fields like bio, social links, and portfolio items empty.
