# Browsing Groups

Groups are the backbone of Tampa.dev. They represent local tech communities, meetups, organizations, and interest groups across the Tampa Bay area. You can browse all groups at [/groups](/groups).

## Finding Groups

The [Groups directory](/groups) lists all active groups on the platform. You can:

- **Search** — Use the search bar to find groups by name.
- **Filter by tags** — Groups are tagged with topics like "JavaScript", "AI/ML", "Networking", "Open Source", and more. Use tag filters to narrow down groups that match your interests.
- **Browse** — Scroll through the directory to discover new communities.

Each group card shows the group name, description, member count, and upcoming event count so you can quickly assess which groups are active and relevant to you.

## Favoriting Groups

When you find a group you like, click the heart/favorite button to add it to your favorites. Favorited groups:

- Appear on your [Favorites page](/favorites) for quick access
- Help you keep track of the communities you care about most

Your favorited groups are private — other members cannot see which groups you've favorited.

## Group Pages

Click on any group to visit its dedicated page. Each group page includes:

- **About** — The group's description, website, social links, and tags.
- **Upcoming events** — A list of the group's next events with dates, times, and venues.
- **Past events** — A history of previous events the group has hosted.
- **Members** — A list of community members who belong to the group.

## Viewing Group Leaderboards

Each group has its own leaderboard that ranks members by XP earned from that group's badges. This lets you see who's most active and engaged in a particular community. You can access a group's leaderboard from their group page.

## Joining Events

From a group page, you can click on any upcoming event to see its details — date, time, venue, description, and RSVP status. If the event supports RSVPs, you can sign up directly from the event page.

Events may have capacity limits. If an event is full, you may be placed on a waitlist and automatically promoted if a spot opens up.

## Group Members List

The members tab on a group page shows everyone who belongs to that group. Members are listed with their display name, profile picture, and role within the group (owner, manager, volunteer, or member). You can click on any member to view their public profile.
