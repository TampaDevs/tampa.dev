# Managing Events

As a group owner or manager, you can create and manage events for your group through the management dashboard. This guide covers the full event lifecycle.

## Creating Events

Navigate to your group's management dashboard and click the **Events** tab, then **Create Event**. Fill in the following details:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Title** | Yes | The name of your event |
| **Description** | Yes | What the event is about, what attendees can expect, and any preparation needed |
| **Date & Time** | Yes | When the event starts. Set both the date and time. |
| **End Time** | No | When the event ends. Helps attendees plan their schedule. |
| **Venue** | No | The physical location or "Online" for virtual events. Include the full address for in-person events so it appears on the map. |
| **Capacity** | No | Maximum number of attendees. Leave blank for unlimited capacity. |

### Tips for Great Events

- **Write clear descriptions** — Include what the event is about, who it's for, and what attendees should bring or prepare.
- **Set accurate venues** — Full addresses help events show up correctly on the [map](/map) view.
- **Set a capacity** if your venue has limited space — this enables waitlist functionality and prevents overcrowding.

## Editing Events

You can edit any of your group's events from the Events tab in the management dashboard. Click on an event to open its details, then make your changes and save.

Changes to events (like time or venue updates) are visible immediately to anyone viewing the event.

## Cancelling Events

To cancel an event, open it from the Events tab and use the cancel option. Cancelled events are marked as cancelled and remain visible so attendees know the event is no longer happening.

## RSVP Management

When you set a capacity on an event, Tampa.dev automatically manages RSVPs:

### Capacity Limits

- Once the number of RSVPs reaches the capacity, the event shows as "Full."
- Additional users who RSVP are placed on a **waitlist**.

### Waitlists

- Users on the waitlist are ordered by when they signed up.
- If an attendee cancels their RSVP, the next person on the waitlist is **automatically promoted** to a confirmed spot.
- Promoted users are notified that their spot has been confirmed.

### Viewing Attendee Stats

From the event detail page in the management dashboard, you can see:

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Confirmed** | Number of confirmed attendees |
| **Waitlisted** | Number of people on the waitlist |
| **Capacity** | The maximum number of attendees you set |
| **Attendee list** | Full list of confirmed attendees and waitlisted users |

This helps you plan for the right amount of space, food, and materials for your event.
