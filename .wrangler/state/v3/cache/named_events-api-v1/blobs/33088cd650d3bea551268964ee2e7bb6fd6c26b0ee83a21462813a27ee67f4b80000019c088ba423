This webinar introduces the Job Seeker Journey Framework, a proprietary approach developed by Computer Coach and refined through 26 years of real-world job placement experience.\nInstead of treating the job search like a collection of disconnected tasks, this framework maps out each phase job seekers move through, from preparation and positioning to interviewing and offer decisions. The session explains how employers think at each stage, where job seekers often get stuck, and how to move forward with intention using a clear, structured process.\nDesigned for active job seekers and career changers, this webinar shows how we use the Job Seeker Journey Framework to guide individuals toward stronger outcomes. Attendees will gain a clear understanding of where they are in the process, what matters most right now, and how to align their efforts with what employers actually respond to.\nThis session offers a practical look at the system that powers our job placement support and helps professionals move through the job market with confidence and direction.\n\nDue to the differing nature of job search processes, this event is for attendees within the United States.

I have been reaching out to some of the past active members in the group to start working on a path forward. The first thing I am looking for is feedback through the discussions.\n\nWe have had a good strong base of developers and we will continue that. I am looking for locations for future meetings, but am also interested in gaging the interest from the members. We have a wide range of members so what I am curious to ask - What is your particular interest? Which of the following lanes would be your lane?\n\n(A) Graphic Design: Visual content creation and image manipulation.\n(B) Automations: Workflow streamlining and repetitive task handling.\n(C) Research: LLM-driven data gathering and reference sourcing.\n(D) Code Development: Software, apps, and website engineering.\n(E) Video Development: AI-generated video and motion graphics.\n(F) Business Admin: Email management, scheduling, and slide production.\n(G) Data Analytics: Pattern recognition and market forecasting.\n(H) Customer Experience: Chatbots and personalized recommendation engines.\n(I) Education: Personalized learning paths and study aids.\n(J) Cybersecurity: Threat detection and automated IT operations.\n(K) Healthcare: Medical imaging and bio-tech research.\n\nDepending on interest, I'd like start planning some discussions for many of these. Right now our core lane will be (D) - Code Development. But - Based on interest we will venture into many of these other lanes as well. One of the things I spoke with one of the active developers about and we want to do this - Vibe coding. And not just in general - but a possible \"Viba-a-thon\" where we state a project goal, and have several developers or teams working within a limited amount of time to develop a solution.
