This webinar introduces the Job Seeker Journey Framework, a proprietary approach developed by Computer Coach and refined through 26 years of real-world job placement experience.\nInstead of treating the job search like a collection of disconnected tasks, this framework maps out each phase job seekers move through, from preparation and positioning to interviewing and offer decisions. The session explains how employers think at each stage, where job seekers often get stuck, and how to move forward with intention using a clear, structured process.\nDesigned for active job seekers and career changers, this webinar shows how we use the Job Seeker Journey Framework to guide individuals toward stronger outcomes. Attendees will gain a clear understanding of where they are in the process, what matters most right now, and how to align their efforts with what employers actually respond to.\nThis session offers a practical look at the system that powers our job placement support and helps professionals move through the job market with confidence and direction.\n\nDue to the differing nature of job search processes, this event is for attendees within the United States.

It is open to everyone. $5 fee for non-members. Payment information is below. **Please note: this is *not* the tool signoff for 3D printing at Tampa Hackerspace. Effective April 2024, this class focuses on PrusaSlicer, rather than Cura.** While Cura offers the broadest printer support for Hackerspace members and nonmembers alike, the audience has shifted since the pandemic to more people looking to use the Prusa machines we have onsite.\n\nThis is a hands-on, online class for anyone who is brand new to 3D printing and wants to get up and running with choosing models and getting them ready to print. We recommend that you join this class from a computer you will be using to prepare models for printing, especially if you are a member of Tampa Hackerspace and plan to use the machines at our site. This class does involve installing software on your computer and following along with the instructor; however, there is no final project, and you are free to listen and take notes instead.\n\nWe’ll take a look at a few sources for models that you may want to print, and we’ll look at how to tell what kinds of modifications your model might need to print successfully. We’ll walk through setting up PrusaSlicer, an interface that will convert the digital images of your model into toolpaths for the printer to make your model into a physical object. Finally, we’ll take a model from .STL to GCode to show you the full process of getting a print ready for production. Once we’re done, we can cover some questions and answers you may have about 3D printing and, if applicable, joining Tampa Hackerspace.\n\nIf you do not already have PrusaSlicer installed, you can download it directly from Prusa (for free!) at [https://www.prusa3d.com/en/page/prusaslicer_424/](https://www.prusa3d.com/en/page/prusaslicer_424/) . We won’t spend much time on the install during class, so you can save yourself some time if you download and install before we meet. I will be in the class a bit early in case you have any questions about downloading and installing the software. (Note that PrusaSlicer runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.)\n\nMembers no charge (unless you no-show!); non-members $5\n\nThe member price is for paid members of Tampa Hackerspace. Information on becoming a paid member can be found on our website (http://tampahackerspace.com/membership). You can prepay for the class at our Square Marketplace (https://tampahackerspace.square.site/product/3d-printing-non-members-/4?cs=true).\n\n***\n\nPayment is expected within 24 hours of your RSVP. If anyone hasn't paid by then, they may shifted to the wait list to make room for other students.\n\n***\n\nIf you've been moved to the waiting list, we couldn't match a payment through Square for the class to your meetup account or verify your membership. If this is in error, please message info@tampahackerspace.com.

I have been reaching out to some of the past active members in the group to start working on a path forward. The first thing I am looking for is feedback through the discussions.\n\nWe have had a good strong base of developers and we will continue that. I am looking for locations for future meetings, but am also interested in gaging the interest from the members. We have a wide range of members so what I am curious to ask - What is your particular interest? Which of the following lanes would be your lane?\n\n(A) Graphic Design: Visual content creation and image manipulation.\n(B) Automations: Workflow streamlining and repetitive task handling.\n(C) Research: LLM-driven data gathering and reference sourcing.\n(D) Code Development: Software, apps, and website engineering.\n(E) Video Development: AI-generated video and motion graphics.\n(F) Business Admin: Email management, scheduling, and slide production.\n(G) Data Analytics: Pattern recognition and market forecasting.\n(H) Customer Experience: Chatbots and personalized recommendation engines.\n(I) Education: Personalized learning paths and study aids.\n(J) Cybersecurity: Threat detection and automated IT operations.\n(K) Healthcare: Medical imaging and bio-tech research.\n\nDepending on interest, I'd like start planning some discussions for many of these. Right now our core lane will be (D) - Code Development. But - Based on interest we will venture into many of these other lanes as well. One of the things I spoke with one of the active developers about and we want to do this - Vibe coding. And not just in general - but a possible \"Viba-a-thon\" where we state a project goal, and have several developers or teams working within a limited amount of time to develop a solution. See where we can get.\n\nPlease drop me some feedback in the Discussions and let's get some talks going on.","dateTime":"2026-02-24T23:00:00.000Z","duration":"PT2H","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/tampa-artificial-intelligence-applications-meetup-group/events/313097184/","status":"ACTIVE","eventType":"ONLINE","rsvpCount":9,"venues":[{"name":"Online event"}],"photo":{"id":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/532479974/676x380.webp","directUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/532479974/676x380.webp"},"group":{"id":"tampa-artificial-intelligence-applications-meetup-group","name":"Tampa Artificial Intelligence Applications Meetup Group","urlname":"tampa-artificial-intelligence-applications-meetup-group","link":"https://www.meetup.com/tampa-artificial-intelligence-applications-meetup-group","memberCount":914,"photo":{"id":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/532480699/676x380.webp","directUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/532480699/676x380.webp"}},"address":null,"googleMapsUrl":null,"photoUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/532479974/676x380.webp","isOnline":true},{"id":"313098088","title":"re:Invent re:Cap - Tampa","description":"**Register here too**: https://aws-experience.com/amer/smb/e/9e4df/reinvent-recap---tampa\n\nJoin us for the re:Cap event series.\nGet a comprehensive summary of key re:Invent 2025 announcements and insights from the keynotes, followed by three deep dive sessions selected from the most popular re:Invent presentations covering Amazon Bedrock, AgentCore, Kiro, and Amazon Quick Suite.\n\n**Instructions**\nMultiple entrances but easiest is off Kennedy.
