We connect young companies with capital and coaching. We help get companies off the ground and on maps. We are home to independent workers including solo entrepreneurs, lawyers, investors, accountants, graphic designers, engineers, and other related occupations geared towards tech startups. Our space is great for small companies, remote workers, startups and anyone who wants to share ideas, knowledge, space and equipment.
