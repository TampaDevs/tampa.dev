Tampa Java User Group (TJUG) is for anyone who uses Java, wants to learn, hire or network with other professionals.

Though this is primarily Java focussed, we also are aware of other programming languages that are gaining popularity and want to expand this group to them as needed.

What we're about

Tampa Java User Group (TJUG) is for anyone who uses JVM, wants to learn, hire or network with other professionals.

The Tampa Java Users Group (TJUG) is organized by Java Developers for Java Developers in order to:

Provide a forum for exchanging information and for brainstorming with other developers on how to successfully implement new Java solutions.

Deliver monthly technical presentations on the latest Java/JVM technologies.

Support the needs of both newbies and experts through related Study Groups targeted at Java Certification and Java-OO architectural issues.

Promote the advantages of Java as a development and deployment environment to the business and educational communities.

While our focus is around Java and the JVM, we also cover a wide variety of other related topics such as Agile development methodologies, mobile and client-side software development frameworks and tools.

There are currently no dues or other formal requirements for joining AJUG. Simply join this Meetup group and start attending our meetings.
