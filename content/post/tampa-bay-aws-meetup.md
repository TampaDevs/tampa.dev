Whether you are an avid user of Amazon Web Services (AWS) today, or you just want to find out more about the advantages of using AWS, we welcome you to join a passionate group of enthusiasts who want to exchange ideas, thoughts, best practices and questions in a comfortable setting where everyone is welcome.

Sometimes we will have a sit-down session, often with subject matter experts (from Amazon or local service providers). Sometimes we will have someone from a local business present their use case for the cloud. And other times we will have an informal happy hour so that we can get to know each other better and to help grow our personal networks.

We are organizing this group because we are passionate about AWS and the cloud. The primary intent of this group is education - not sales. All presentations will be educational in scope. That being said, the AWS ecosystem includes many roles - technical users, service providers, staffing, training and others. All are encouraged to participate and contribute!

Jefferson Frank is our premier sponsor, and assists us with finding great content and speakers for our event as well as event space. If you or your company would like to get involved, either as a host, sponsor, or speaker, please contact Jeff Fudge.
