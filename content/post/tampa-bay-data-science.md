For professional data scientists and analysts in the Tampa Bay area interested in Analysis, Massive Parallel Computing, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Data Mining, and the supporting technologies and practices.


This is for professional data scientists and analysts in the Tampa Bay area interested in Analysis, Massive Parallel Computing, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Data Mining, and the supporting technologies and practices. We pull together the best minds in the region to discover and discuss the trends in our technical, methodological, and professional ecosystems. We are dedicated to establishing the Tampa Bay region as a center of excellence for interdisciplinary information analytics.

This group is in part sponsored by the Microsoft Data Science User Group Sponsorship Program (http://msdsug.microsoft.com/), Wolters Kluwer, and CGRII (http://cgrii.org/). Microsoft, Wolters Kluwer, and CGRII are not responsible for content on this website or activities that take place at user group meetings.

We also are supporters of the Suncoast Developers Guild (https://www.meetup.com/suncoast-devs/) and adhere to their code of conduct (http://suncoast.io/conduct/). In addition to this code of conduct, we also encourage code attribution.

In order to ensure proper credit is given to developers or development teams, an effort should be made to indicate attribution of programs, scripts, and code snippets. This should include, but is not limited to: name of person/group; location of source (URL, event name/location); date/time of information. This ensures that provenance is maintained and that all parties involved in the collaborative effort are noted for their contributions to the best of oneâ€™s knowledge.
