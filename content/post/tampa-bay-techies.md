Tampa Bay Techies is a 501(c)(3) organization that promotes personal and professional growth for individuals in the technology community through networking, mentorship, volunteering, and training. Tampa Bay Techies hosts a variety of in- person events free to attend, all which emphasize networking with fellow members and established professionals. 

Our organization brings together a passionate and diverse team of individuals who are united by a shared vision: to empower individuals from all walks of life to thrive in the technology field. We strive to bridge the opportunity gap by providing comprehensive training programs, mentorship, and resources that equip individuals with the skills and confidence they need to succeed in the tech landscape.


Tampa Bay Techies was founded in 2023. It began as an IT Study Group, but quickly evolved into a group of individuals looking for opportunities to become more involved in the technology industry and Tampa Bay community. In the world of remote work, we gave our members a space to socialize with others in the industry outside of the workplace. We became a place for individuals to both teach and learn from each other without judgement. As we expand as an organization, we hope to continue to provide opportunities and resources for our members to succeed.
Our Values
Network.

Our first value is networking with others in the group and in the industry. We believe that networking opens doors to endless opportunities to optimize our personal and professional lives.
Learn.

Our second value is to learn continuously. Our members are enthusiastic, curious, and passionate for learning and personal development. These are all valuable qualities in the technology field. We believe in learning from each other as well as our mentors.
Engage.

Our third value is engaging with yourself and the community. Understanding your strengths and weaknesses is key in personal development. We believe in setting personal and professional goals and fulfilling those goals. As members, we engage through social events, educational events, and volunteer events. Engaging with the community and others in the industry is an essential part of being a Tampa Bay Techies member.
Lead.

Our fourth and most important value is to lead others. Leading others to success is the premise of what Tampa Bay Techies was built upon. We encourage our members to lead and empower others on their journey to success.
