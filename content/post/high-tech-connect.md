High Tech Connect’s mission is to be the interconnecting mesh for Tampa’s growing tech community.


Tampa Bay is Florida’s Tech Capital and an emerging national tech hub. High Tech Connect’s mission is to be the interconnecting mesh for Tampa’s growing tech community.


Founded in 2018, High Tech Connect started as a way to bring together multiple facets of the tech community at one event. We saw a community that wanted interconnectivity outside of interest-specific Meetup groups. 

By hosting High Tech Connect Tech Fests, our goal is for community to be nurtured in a casual and comfortable space of like minded individuals. From students trying to settle on their future career-path, to seasoned investors looking for the next big thing, High Tech Connect is bridging the Tampa tech community.
