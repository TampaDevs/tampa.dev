All of this support is provided inside Embarc Collective's 32,000 square-foot physical space located in downtown Tampa as well as virtually.

In addition to serving as the home to our member community, Embarc Collective offers spaces for the Tampa Bay community to host large-scale programming on entrepreneurship, innovation, and technology, providing a central landing zone for the Tampa Bay startup community.
