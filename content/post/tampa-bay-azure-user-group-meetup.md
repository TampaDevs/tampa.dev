The goal of this Azure user group is to provide a community-based organization to build our collective knowledge of the benefits of Azure and also provide networking opportunities with like-minded individuals and organizations. All are invited to attend: end user companies, MSP's, staffing agencies, or anyone else that would like to learn more about Microsoft Azure and the cloud.

Instead of only having sessions on technical deep dives, we will have a strong focus on successful case studies, so you will not only learn about the technical aspects of Azure but you will also learn how local companies are leveraging Azure for competitive advantage.
