If you are looking for more in life than surface level discussions, and boring 9-5 jobs, join us! We specialize in anything and everything technologically innovative in society today (and the future). Mostly, the subject matter will be emerging technology trends and professional development; however, we can add more subjects based on a vote. We will have fun, but, also be educated by leaders throughout the community through workshops and panel discussions, and HAPPY HOURS! Please join if you want to grow and learn the tools you need for success!
