This is a group for anyone interested in software QA and testing. All skill levels are welcome. We will have regular meetups to discuss various topics in software testing and QA.

Tampa QA Meetup is a community of QA professionals in the Tampa Bay, Florida area who come together to share knowledge, experiences, and best practices related to software testing, quality assurance, and related topics. The group typically holds regular meetups or events where members can network with peers, learn from guest speakers, participate in workshops, and engage in discussions on a variety of QA-related topics.

The events can be a great opportunity for QA professionals to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in the industry, as well as to meet and connect with others in the field.
