Our Tech4Good group brings together nonprofits in need of technology guidance, education, and/or troubleshooting AND technology folks interested in helping nonprofits pro bono with their technology questions/needs.

NONPROFIT STAFF will find a friendly, welcoming atmosphere for those who aren't experienced with technology, and many chances to ask questions of tech-experienced nonprofits and experts.

TECHNOLOGISTS AND CONSULTANTS will find opportunities to put your expertise to social good, as well as the potential for lasting relationships with local nonprofits.

ACTIVISTS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS will see and be given the opportunity to present on successful uses of technology for social change. Not content to simply focus on "shiny tech," we'll explore what the true potential for social change is in each case, where community organizing work can be made more effective, and where it will have to push technology forward.
