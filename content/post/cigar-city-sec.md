CitySec is an unaffiliated collection of informal meetups for like-minded security professionals. CitySec groups meet to discuss topics of interest in a non-work, non-vendor setting; preferably while drinking.

CitySec meetups are like any other professional society meeting, except:

    There's no professional society
    There's no membership
    There's no dues
    There's no cover charge
    There's no corporate sponsorship
    There's no vendor pitches
    There's no requirement to RSVP
    There's no fixed agenda
    They're publicly announced and open to all
